I couldn't create a script that would do it so here are the terminal commands line by line:
mkdir /home/$USER/public_html
sudo ln -s /home/../tmp /var/www/html

if not working:
sudo chmod o+x /home/ /home/$USER/ /home/$USER/public_html

if still not working:
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
"allowoverride Indexes" instead of none
and restart the service(services apache2 stop, services apache2 start)

if you can create the script feel free to contact me with it, either using email or with a pull request. It is worth it for you
